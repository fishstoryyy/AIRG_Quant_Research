    - click the button
    - copy the http link : https://github.com/fishstoryyy/airg_quant.git

#Second, open your terminal and change your directory to Desktop (or elsewhere)
    - by using the command : cd ~/Desktop
    - next, in terminal, enter : 
        git clone https://github.com/fishstoryyy/airg_quant.git
    - you shall now see a folder named airg_quant on your desktop
    - you may use unix command : cd airg_quant
    - OR simply open the folder to check what's inside(nothing useful so far though)
